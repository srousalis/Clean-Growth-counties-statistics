# Clean-Growth-counties-statistics
This repository provides the code for generating statistics at the U.S. county level using data on the [electrical grid](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fj879h77amgso5kefeh3s/Replication_Grid.zip?rlkey=lha5an6ypha7xzrghl20vg602&e=1&dl=0) from [Clean Growth](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b4b997eda02bc592b5131cd/t/64e38ceeb5dae75b3b9cb7e3/1692634362860/CleanGrowth.pdf) (Arkolakis and Walsh, 2023). 

The code computes the length of transmission lines by maximum capacity category and the generation capacity of power plants by type (fossil, renewable, solar, wind) across U.S. counties.  

## Overview:
The electrical grid data is located in the data/grid_output directory, and the output generated by the code is saved in data/counties_output. The final dataset produced by this replication package is counties_lines_plants_statistics.csv.

Within the code folder, the main script responsible for generating the output is master.py.
